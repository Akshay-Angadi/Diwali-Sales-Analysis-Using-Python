# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-Using-Python

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to increase revenue and improve customer experience through data analysis of Diwali sales data. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we aim to gain insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and product preferences. These insights will inform strategic decisions to enhance sales during the Diwali season.

## Project Overview
Diwali is one of the most significant festivals in India, characterized by increased consumer spending on a wide range of products. To maximize sales and provide a better shopping experience, it is essential to understand the customer base and their preferences.

This repository contains Python code and data files for performing EDA on various aspects of Diwali sales, including:
- Gender Analysis: Understanding the distribution of sales by gender.
- Age Analysis: Analyzing the age groups of customers and their purchasing patterns.
- State Analysis: Identifying sales trends in different states or regions.
- Marital Status Analysis: Exploring the impact of marital status on sales.
